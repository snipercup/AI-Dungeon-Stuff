This is a script designed to track properties of autocards. Only cards generated by autocards are considered. 
Currently, it tracks the number of triggers and the last turn it was triggered.
There are also cleanup functions.

I designed it to be modular and easy to add to. The library offers some functions to run code against, so you can come up with your own functions.
It is designed to work with Live Scripting Interface v2 as provided by Autocards.

Installation:
1. Enable LSIv2 in the configure autocards storycard in your adventure
2. Put the library.js contents in the shared library story card in your adventure
3. put the contents of output modifier.js in the output modifier story card.
4. When the cardKeeper story card is generated, you know it's working.

Extending the script:
Write your own function in the output modifier and add it to the registry so it will be run:
```
processorRegistry = [incrementTriggerCount,updateLastTurn];
scheduledProcessorRegistry = [
  { fn: markEmptyTrackedCards, every: 25 },
  { fn: removeStaleTrackedCards, every: 30 },
  { fn: cleanupTrackedCards, every: 20 }
];
```
The processorRegistry functions take one card registry object and run it against a triggered card
The scheduledprocessor registry functions take the content of the cardKeeper story card and run code against all objects inside it.
