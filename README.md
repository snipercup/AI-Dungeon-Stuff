Some interesting stuff relating to AI dungeon

Check out the [azgaar importer](https://github.com/snipercup/AI-Dungeon-Stuff/tree/main/AzgaarImporter)

This is from Onyx, a user in the AID discord server:
## Generator generator:
"I actually came up with the idea for the generator generator based on the scenario we used to have that generated a prompt based on tags, but I figured it could be used to generate cities or kingdoms or whatever as well."

"Generate anything by filling in the blanks.
Hint: In the "thing you want to generate" field, you can do something like "character (appearance, personality, history)" to steer the sort of things the AI comes up with for it."

(sometimes the name generator takes a dump, like if you try to get it to create ocean names it'll spew a lot of real oceans unless you tweak the tags considerably)
